Just some nerd's personal blog, developer, motorcycle enthusiast, cat person.

The business side of this blog is mostly about  programming tips, some research Resource.

I also like to post about my hobbies…pet, nerdy home projects and whenever I have time.

Hope you enjoy what you’re reading here!
